Define Python Loops and explain the classification of Python loops.

ans=> 
python loops is iterating function used when we need to execute certain statement or operation certain times or until the condition meet.
there are two types of python loops 
1. for loop and 2. while loop.
 -for loop is used only when we know number of iterations needed to execute certain operation.
 -while loop is only in that case when we dont know number of iteration needed to execute some function or other operation.
 -if the condition is not given in while then while can execute that condition for infinite times .
 -to break while loop or for loop we can use break statement. and in case of to proceed for next iteration we can use continue keyword.
