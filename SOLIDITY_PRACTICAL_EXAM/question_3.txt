3) Write a Smart Contract for understanding View and Pure
Functions in Solidity Programming Language.

ans :


* view functions in solidity : view functions in solidity is the one of the function type that have view visiblity . this type of functions
are the view purpose only . this type of functions doesnot modifies state variables or neither executes transaction on blockchain.
also this type of functions have access to state variables .

* pure functions in solidity : this type of functions in solidity doesnot read the data from state variables as well as doesnot modifies state variables data . pure functions can take input and  calcultion or logic get executed only within function using local variables.


following smart contract explains both view and pure functions :


  pragma >=0.8;
  
contract Functions_explanation{
       
       //state variables
       uint x=10;
       uint y=20;
      
     // view function example
     function view_function_example() public view returns (uint z){

       return (x);
}

    //pure function example

     function sum_using_pure() public pure returns(uint m){
       uint l=20;
       uint n=40;
       return (l+n)
}

}
