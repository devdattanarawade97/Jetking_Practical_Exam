2) Write a Smart Contract for understanding Global Variables in
Solidity Programming Language. 

ans : 


global variables are the variable that are predefined by solidity and those variables are accessibles anywhere in contract as well as outside of contract . for example  , msg.sender , emit , event ,require , revert , modifier. etc



 contract Variable_explanation{
      
       address public owner;
       uint x=10;
        uint y=20;
        event(string);
        
          constructor(address owner){
          owner=msg.sender;
}
        
        function addsum() public returns(uint z){
           require(msg.sender==owner , 'only owner can execute this fucntion')
           emit(msg.sender)
           return (x+y);
}


}
